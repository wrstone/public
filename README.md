These are simply files I'm placing into the public domain.

Due to the United States Federal Goverment's interference, the cloud is simply unsafe.  Consequently, I have pulled all private data back to my own servers.  While it's true that they would be able to confiscate those drives, they would have to go the extra step of getting a warrent.  If one uses the cloud, your data is pulled real-time.

However, there are files I wish to be public.  These are they.
